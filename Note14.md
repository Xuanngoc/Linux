Using __NFS__ (the Network File System) is one of the methods used for sharing data across physical systems.
Many system administrators mount remote _users' home_ directories on __a server__ in order to give them __access__ to the _same files_ and configuration files across _multiple_ client systems.
This allows the users to log in to _different machines_ yet still have access to the _same files_ and _resources_.
