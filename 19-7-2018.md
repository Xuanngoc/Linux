**Compiler** is a programming language translator which converts High Level Language program to its equivalent Intermediate Code. Compiler read complete program once and compiles complete code.

**Interpreter** is a programming language translator which converts _High Level_  Language program to its equivalent Machine Code. Interpreter reads program line by line or we can say statement by statement and if statement is error free, it converts into machine code.

# Filesystem
----
Filesystem types that Linux supports are:
  1. ext3, ext4, btrfs, xfs (native Linux filesystems)
  2. vfat, ntfs, hfs (filesystems from other operating systems)
Each filesystem resides on a hard disk partition. Partitions help to organize the contents of disks according to the kind of data contained and how it is used.

### The home directories 
In any UNIX system, each user has his own home directory, usually placed under ``/home``. 
The ``/home`` directory is often mounted as a **separate filesystem** on its own partition, or even exported remotely on a network through NFS.

### The binary directories 
The ``/bin`` directory contains executable binaries.
The ``/sbin`` directory is used for essential binaries related to system administration, such as ifconfig and shutdown.

### The device directory
 The ``/dev`` directory contains device nodes, a type of pseudo-file used by most hardware and software devices, __except__ for network devices. 
 The ``udev``, which creates and manages device nodes on Linux.
 The ``/dev`` is empty on the disk partition when it isn't mounted but it contains entries which are created by ``/udev``.

### The variable directory
 
The ``/var`` directory contains files that are expected to change in size and content as the system is running.
Such as the entries in the following directories:
   + System log files: ``/var/log``
   + Packages files: ``/var/lib``
   + Print queues: ``/var/spool``
   + Temp files: ``/var/tmp``
   + FTP home directory: ``/var/ftp``
   +  Web Server directory: ``/var/www``
### The system configuration directory 
The ``/etc`` directory is the home for system configuration files.

### The boot directory 
The ``/boot`` directory contains the few essential files needed to boot the system. 

### The libraries directory 
The ``/lib`` contains libraries (common code shared by applications and needed for them to run) for the essential programs in ``/bin`` and ``/sbin`` folders. 

### Additional directories 
|Directory|Usage|
|:---------:|-----|
| /opt | Optional application software packages |
| /sys | Virtual pseudo-filesystem giving information about the system and the hardware. Can be used to alter system parameters and for debugging purposes. |
| /srv | Site-specific data served up by the system. Seldom used. |
| /tmp | Temporary files; on some distributions these files are erased across a reboot |
| /media | It is typically located where removable media, such as CDs, DVDs and USB drives are mounted. Unless configuration prohibits it, Linux automatically mounts the removable media in this directory when they are detected. |
| /usr | Multi-user applications, utilities and data |
| /usr/include | Header files used to compile applications |
| /usr/lib | Libraries for binary programs |
| /usr/lib64 | 64bit Libraries for binary programs |
| /usr/share | Shared data used by applications, generally architecture-independent |
| /usr/src | Source code, usually for the Linux kernel |
| /usr/local | Data and programs specific to the local machine. |


# File permissions

In Linux and other UNIX operating systems, every file is associated with a user who is the owner. Every file is also associated with a group which has an interest in the file and certain rights, or permissions: read, write, and execute.

|Command|Result|
|-------|-----------|
|chown|Used to change user ownership of a file or directory|
|chgrp|Used to change group ownership|
|chmod|Used to change the permissions on the file|

Files have three kinds of permissions: read (**r**), write (**w**), execute (**x**). These are generally represented as in the following order **rwx**. These permissions affect three groups of owners: user (**u**), group (**g**), and others (**o**). As a result, you have the following three groups of three permissions:

|rwx:|rwx:|rwx|
|----|----|---|
|u:|g:|o|

There are a number of different ways to use the ``chmod`` command. For instance, to give the owner execute permission:

```
$ ls -l test1
-rw-rw-r-- 1 joy caldera 1601 Mar 9 15:04 test1
$ chmod u+x test1
$ ls -l test1
-rwxrw-r-- 1 joy caldera 1601 Mar 9 15:04 test1
```

This kind of syntax can be difficult to type and remember, so one often uses a shorthand which lets you set all the permissions in one step. This is done with a simple algorithm, and a single digit suffices to specify all three permission bits for each entity. This digit is the sum of:

* 4 if read permission is desired.
* 2 if write permission is desired.
* 1 if execute permission is desired.

Thus 7 means read+write+execute, 6 means read+write, and 5 means read+execute.

When you apply this to the ``chmod`` command you have to give three digits for each degree of freedom, such as in
```
$ chmod 755 test1
$ ls -l test1
-rwxr-xr-x 1 joy caldera 1601 Mar 9 15:04 test1
```
The group ownership is changed by using the ``chgrp`` command
```
# ll /home/mina/myfile.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 mina caldera 679 Feb 19 16:51 /home/mina/myfile.txt
# chgrp root /home/mina/myfile.txt
# ll /home/mina/myfile.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 mina root 679 Feb 19 16:51 /home/mina/myfile.txt
```
